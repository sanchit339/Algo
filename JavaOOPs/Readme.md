### Flow of the Concepts
- Class N Objects
- Packages Singleton Class
- Inheritance , Polymorphism , Encapsulation
- Access Control
- Abstraction and Interfaces
- Exception Handling

### Important KeyWords in Each
- Class and Object
    - Class c_name = new Class();
    - c_name.Methods to access;

- Inheritance
    - super(parameters)
    - Extends (Class c_name extends parent_class)

- Polymorphism
    - Compile Time (Method OverLoading)
    - Runtime (Method Overriding)
    - Upcasting (Same Parent diff Children :) )

- Abstraction (Abstract KeyWord)
    - Same as normal class with ```Variables``` ans ```Methods```.
    - can have abstract a non-abstract methods.
    - Make the parent class as Abstract and rest is same as the inheritance.

- Exception
    - Method ```throws``` Error ```[static int method( ) thorws exception{}]```
    - inside we method we ```throw``` the error
